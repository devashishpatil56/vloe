# vloe
Python based scheduling and orchestration tool

Vision:
- Create a scheduer which is intuitive to use.
- Onboarding vloe should be simple and easy
- Should have versioning for the pipelines
- Easier to debug and scale
- Pipelines to be editable via UI as well as code

Good to have features:
- Easy provisioning in major cloud platforms/cloud native
- Git and CICD support out of the box
